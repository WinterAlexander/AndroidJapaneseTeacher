# AndroidJapaneseTeacher
An Android application originally created to make you learn different japanese alphabets. 
The application might expand to the teaching of different concepts of the japanese language.

For now, the application is just a quiz. You can learn from being asked in the quiz but there's
no way to see all the characters.
