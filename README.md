# AndroidJapaneseTeacher
An Android application originally created to make you learn different japanese alphabets. It basically works by showing you a japanese character and ask you what is its corresponding romaji.
The application might expand to the teaching of different concepts of the japanese language.

### Supported alphabets:

For now, the application is only a quiz. You can learn from being asked in the quiz but there's
no way to see all the characters. However, the character selection system is intelligent. When you fail to recognize a character, it will ask you the character you just failed and the one you actually entered, by accident. This lets a player learn his characters simply by pressing on the "Don't know" button and entering the valid romaji that just got displayed under his eyes until he is at the point where he recognize them. It even has a system to detect typo and prevent failing the quiz on an invalid input.

### Quiz examples:

#### Hiragana :

#### Invalid input prevention :

As you could see, the application has a french and english translation. However, the Kanji description (you will see in the Failing screen) is french only for now.

### Miss screen:

When character is interchanged with another:

When the user doesn't know what to answer:

## Origin

I originally made this app as a console application for personnal use. It was only in french and very sloppy but when I was introducted to Android development at school, I decided to do it on my tablet and polish it a bit. Plus, having it on my tablet lets me pratice while I couldn't in other situations. Some friends got interested to and made me adapt the application to all phone sizes.

#### Example on a very small screen:
